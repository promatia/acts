#Promatia Organizations Act

##Update Information
This document is going to cover a number of changes, and is required reading for all current members of the Genesis Council and future members of the Senate.

**Change 1**: Genesis Council is now "Senate". All instances or occurrences in reference to the Genesis Council need to be changed to Senate. This is being done for a number of reasons. It reduces complexity in explaining the system of government to others, it makes reference to the genesis of something, and could be mistaken for "founding member".

**Change 2**: Gen is now "Senator". A Senator is the highest seat of government in the state of Promatia. This is simply to reflect the first change. I advocate "SEN" to be a proposed replacement short code.

**Change 3**: Prime Executive Minister is now "Minister". The job does not change, only the title does. This is just for ease of use, the title "MIN" is the proposed short code.

**Change 4**: Enhanced Government Institution is now "Government Department". The organizational structure does not change, and is still lead by a Minister. The short code "EGI" is to be replaced by "GD", but functions in much the same way. Government Department better describes the actual function of these divisional government branches.

These simple changes improve Promatia's level of professionalism and regularizes Promatian lingo to better fit what people already know. It also helps move Promatia further from its controversial connection to Promatia. These changes in term also allows a more fair fit for new nations seeking to unite with Promatia, and better acclimation and equality of power for newly arriving governmental staff.
