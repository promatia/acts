# Territory Act

## Division 1: Territory
### Section 1: Claimed Territory
The territory of Promatia under the authority of the Government encompasses all territory of the Commonwealth of Australia east of the 135th meridian east, north of the 17th parallel south, and south of the 15th parallel south.

### Section 2: Self-Determination
#### Paragraph 1: Cities & Towns
1. All towns and cities existing in Promatia before the creation of Promatia have the right to vote on whether or not to remain a part of Promatia or to leave.
2. If they decide to leave, the territory of their town will become a part of normal Australia and this act will be automatically amended to include that territory, as determined by the Minister of Land.
3. There may not exist enclaves of Australia in Promatia and vice versa; as such, territory must be continuous and towns that decide to remain a part of Australia must have a reasonable pathway into the other parts of Australia without entering Promatian territory.

#### Paragraph 2: Aboriginal Populations
Aboriginal tribes have the right to choose, without threat of violence, coercion, or any other means that threatens their democratic will, one of the following through a democratic vote of its members:
1. To join Promatia with no Aboriginal State ("AS"), following all Government laws and equal to all non-aboriginal cities of Promatia.
2. To join Promatia with an AS, with the ability to exempt itself from Government laws and authority but remain a *de jure* part of Promatia.
3. To remain a part of the normal territory of the Commonwealth of Australia and reject joining Promatia, in which case the same rules apply for cities and territories as for their territory.
